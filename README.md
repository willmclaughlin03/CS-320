How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring code is functional and secure always comes down to testing your code. Testing your code allows you to see how your code holds up security wise, and how well it performs its functions. Without testing, your code is useless; there is no better way to test the value of it.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs comes down to finding what your users need, through interviews or surveys, and analyzing those needs. After careful thought on what the users need, you then can make decisions on how to best meet the needs in code, and what needs you need to address. Finding user needs is important to maintaining software and a user base.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software carefully, almost like putting together a puzzle. The flow should go as; having an idea, excecuting on that idea through writing code to bring it to life, carefully testing the code, then deploying to fix a problem you saw, creating a tool people can use.
